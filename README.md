## Persistent Memory System

One of the most powerful features of this project is its ability to maintain context across different coding sessions. Think of it as giving your AI assistant a "memory" that doesn't forget what you've been working on, even when you close VSCode and come back later.

### How It Works

Imagine you're working on a complex project that spans multiple days or weeks. Normally, each time you start a new coding session, you'd need to re-explain your project's context to the AI assistant. With the Memory Bank:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Session[New Session] --> Load[Load Context]
    Load --> Read[Read Files]
    Read --> Update[Update Context]
    Update --> Write[Write Changes]
    Write --> Track[Track Progress]
    Track --> Record[Record Decisions]
    Record --> Ready[Ready for Tasks]
```

- Your AI assistant remembers previous discussions and decisions
- Maintains understanding of your project's architecture and goals
- Keeps track of ongoing tasks and progress
- Remembers your coding preferences and project conventions

### Key Benefits

1. **Continuity Across Sessions**
   - No need to re-explain your project every time
   - Pick up exactly where you left off
   - Maintains consistent understanding of your codebase

2. **Smart Context Management**
   - Automatically tracks important technical decisions
   - Records project progress and milestones
   - Maintains documentation of your development journey

3. **Enhanced Productivity**
   - Faster project onboarding for each session
   - More consistent and contextual AI assistance
   - Reduces repetitive explanations

4. **Project History**
   - Keeps track of why certain decisions were made
   - Maintains a log of completed features and changes
   - Helps new team members understand project evolution

The Memory Bank seamlessly integrates with the Cline VSCode Extension, requiring no additional setup from you once configured. It works quietly in the background, ensuring your AI assistant always has the context it needs to provide relevant and helpful assistance.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later)
- VS Code with Cline extension installed
- TypeScript (for development)

### Setup Steps

1. Clone and build the server:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GlacierEQ/cline-mcp-memory-bank
cd cline-mcp-memory-bank

# Install dependencies (using pnpm as recommended)
pnpm install

# Build the server
pnpm run build

# Make globally available (optional, requires pnpm setup for global linking)
# pnpm link --global 
```

2. Configure Cline Extension (Recommended: Use Initialization Command):

   **Recommended Method:** After building, run the initialization command from the project root. This automatically creates the memory bank files and configures the Cline MCP settings for you:
   ```bash
   node build/index.js initialize_memory_bank . 
   ```

   **Manual Method (If needed):** Add the following to your Cline MCP settings file. The initialization command detects an existing settings file automatically; set `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH` to point at a custom location.
   - **Linux:** `~/.config/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` (or `Code - Insiders`)
   - **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/globalStorage/saoudrizwan.claude-dev/settings/cline_mcp_settings.json` (or `Code - Insiders`)
   - **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Code\User\globalStorage\saoudrizwan.claude-dev\settings\cline_mcp_settings.json` (or `Code - Insiders`)

   Add this JSON object:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory-bank": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/cline-memory-bank/build/index.js"
      ],
      "env": {
        "PROJECT_PATH": "/path/to/project"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/cline-memory-bank` with the actual, absolute path to your server installation (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Projects\cline-mcp-memory-bank` on Windows). **Note:** Using the initialization command above handles this automatically, including the `PROJECT_PATH` environment variable used by MCP resources.

## Features

### Tools

After installation and building, initialize the memory bank for your project by running this command in the project's root directory:
```bash
node /path/to/cline-mcp-memory-bank/build/index.js initialize_memory_bank .
```
(Replace `/path/to/cline-mcp-memory-bank` with the actual path where you cloned and built the server).

Alternatively, if the server is configured in Cline, you can ask Cline to run the tool: `initialize the memory bank`.

Once initialized, you can ask Cline to update the memory bank context, record decisions, or track progress using the tools below, or configure it via `.clinerules` or the system prompt.

1. `initialize_memory_bank`
   - Creates Memory Bank structure for a new project
   - Creates required markdown files with initial templates
   - Safe to run repeatedly: existing files are preserved unless `force: true`
   ```typescript
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'initialize_memory_bank', {
     projectPath: '/path/to/project',
     force: false
   });
   ```

2. `update_context`
   - Updates active context with current session information
   - Tracks mode, tasks, and session state
   ```typescript
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'update_context', {
     projectPath: '/path/to/project',
     content: {
       currentSession: {
         date: '2025-03-13',
         mode: 'development',
         task: 'Implementing new feature'
       }
     }
   });
   ```

3. `record_decision`
   - Records technical decisions with rationale
   - `proposed` decisions are filed under Pending Decisions; all other statuses under Technical Decisions
   - Maintains history of architectural choices
   ```typescript
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'record_decision', {
     projectPath: '/path/to/project',
     decision: {
       title: 'Authentication System',
       description: 'Implementing JWT-based authentication',
       rationale: 'Better scalability and stateless operation',
       status: 'accepted',
       alternatives: [
         'Session-based auth',
         'OAuth only'
       ]
     }
   });
   ```

4. `track_progress`
   - Updates project progress and milestones
   - Manages task status and blockers
   ```typescript
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'track_progress', {
     projectPath: '/path/to/project',
     progress: {
       phase: 'Implementation',
       completed: ['Setup project', 'Initialize database'],
       inProgress: ['Implement auth', 'Create API routes'],
       blocked: ['Deploy to production']
     }
   });
   ```

### Resources

1. `memory://project/context`
   - Project overview and technical stack
   - Architecture principles and guidelines

2. `memory://active/context`
   - Current session state and tasks
   - Active considerations and notes

3. `memory://progress`
   - Project milestones and task tracking

### System Prompt Suggestion

Add to Cline system prompt or `.clinerules` file under settings.

```
Memory Bank Integration Rules:

CRITICAL: Before ANY task or response:
1. ALWAYS check active context (memory://active/context):
   - Current project state and mode
   - Ongoing tasks and their status
   - Recent decisions and updates
   - Open questions and concerns

2. ALWAYS review project context (memory://project/context):
   - Technical stack and dependencies
   - Project guidelines and standards
   - Architecture principles
   - Development workflow

3. ALWAYS consult decision log (memory://decisions) for:
   - Previous architectural choices
   - Established patterns
   - Technical rationales
   - Related decisions

4. ALWAYS check progress tracking (memory://progress):
   - Current phase and milestones
   - Completed work
   - In-progress tasks
   - Known blockers

After EVERY task:
1. Update active context with:
   - Task completion status
   - New information learned
   - Changes made

2. Record any technical decisions with:
   - Clear rationale
   - Considered alternatives
   - Impact assessment

3. Update progress tracking:
   - Mark completed items
   - Add new tasks identified
   - Note any blockers found

Key Guidelines:
- NEVER proceed without checking memory bank context
- ALWAYS maintain consistent project state
- Record ALL significant technical decisions
- Track progress in real-time
- Keep context updated with EVERY change
```
## File Structure

When initialized, the Memory Bank creates the following structure in your project:

```mermaid
graph LR
    Root[Project Root] --> Bank[memory-bank]
    Bank --> PC[projectContext.md]
    Bank --> AC[activeContext.md]
    Bank --> P[progress.md]
    Bank --> DL[decisionLog.md]
    PC --> Stack[Technical Stack]
    AC --> Tasks[Active Tasks]
    P --> Status[Project Status]
    DL --> History[Decision History]
```

### Initial File Contents

Upon initialization, each file is populated with structured content:

1. `activeContext.md`:
   - Current session information with timestamp
   - Initial tasks (Project initialization, Environment setup)
   - Open questions about project goals and requirements
   - Recent updates section

2. `progress.md`:
   - Current phase (Initialization)
   - Initial completed tasks (Repository setup, Basic structure)
   - In-progress tasks (Environment configuration, Documentation)
   - Upcoming tasks section
   - Blockers tracking

3. `decisionLog.md`:
   - Initial project structure decisions
   - Development workflow choices with alternatives
   - Documentation strategy decisions
   - Section for pending decisions

4. `projectContext.md`:
   - Project overview and version
   - Detected technical stack and dependencies
   - Configuration files listing
   - Architecture principles
   - Development setup instructions
   - Project workflow guidelines

## Using with Cline

```mermaid
graph LR
    Start[Start] --> Init[Initialize]
    Init --> Context[Load Context]
    Context --> Update[Make Changes]
    Update --> Progress[Track Progress]
    Progress --> Record[Record Decisions]
    Record --> Sync[Auto Sync]
    Sync --> Context
```

Simply ask Cline to initialize the memory bank.  

1. Initialize a new Memory Bank:
   ```
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'initialize_memory_bank', {
     projectPath: process.cwd()  // or specific path
   });
   ```

2. Access project context:
   ```
   access_mcp_resource('memory-bank', 'memory://project/context');
   ```

3. Update session context:
   ```
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'update_context', {
     projectPath: process.cwd(),
     content: {
       currentSession: {
         date: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
         mode: 'development',
         task: 'Current task description'
       }
     }
   });
   ```

4. Record technical decisions:
   ```
   use_mcp_tool('memory-bank', 'record_decision', {
     projectPath: process.cwd(),
     decision: {
       title: 'Decision Title',
       description: 'What was decided',
       rationale: 'Why it was decided'
     }
   });
   ```

## Development

To modify or enhance the server:

1. Update source in `src/index.ts`
2. Run the test suite: `npm test` (builds first, then runs the MCP integration tests)
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Audit dependencies: `npm audit`
5. Restart the Cline extension to load changes

The tests exercise the CLI, the stdio MCP protocol, all four tools, and all four resources against temporary fixture projects.

## Deployment

Pushing to `main` or opening a pull request can run the hosted workflow defined in [`docs/ci-workflow.yml`](docs/ci-workflow.yml). The same checks run locally with:

```bash
npm ci
npm run ci          # build, test suite, and production dependency audit
# or: make ci
```

To enable hosted CI, copy `docs/ci-workflow.yml` to `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and push it with credentials that are allowed to update workflow files.

To publish a release:

```bash
npm test
npm pack --dry-run     # inspect the package contents
npm publish            # requires npm credentials
```

Consumers can then run the server without a local checkout:

```bash
npx -y memory-bank-server initialize_memory_bank /path/to/project
```

The package only ships `build/`, `README.md`, and `LICENSE`; the `prepare` script builds `build/index.js` automatically on install.
